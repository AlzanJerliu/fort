# Password-Manager
Password Manager v1.0

## Introduction
Password Manager created in python with json and sqlite to store user data and encrypted passwords.

## Usage
```
--Login  #Already created account
  --insert        #insert into database
  --display       #display whole database
  --show          #show selected password and decrypt it
  --logout        #logout of current acount
--Signup #Create new account
--Erase  #Delete account!!!
```

## Development
Still working on this project.
The Erase functionality is currently not provided as it creates some issues, will add that in future.
More functions like displaying * while typing password will be added after I finish some other projects.
